# cyf-first-api for Week 2 

This is the 1st API for the task of week 2. It is a simple nodeJS app that returns your lucky number and makes an api call to API2.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit variables in index.js i.e. URL, YOUR_NAME and YOUR_LUCKY_NUMBER.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Proceed to deploy on AWS ec2 instance.


### Notes on the project

* This project has no security measures and has the tendency to break in the future.
* If that happens (breaks), delete the node modules and run 'npm install' command in your cyf-first-api directory.
* Do not save keys plainly in your forked repo, talking from experience.
* Try to stick with free-tier ubuntu images instaed of AWS Linux as ubuntu versions have more active users.


### Conclusion

I am open to questions and pull requests. Happy hacking. Cheers.
